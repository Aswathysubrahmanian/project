        <h3>10 Major Benefits of Drinking COFFEE</h3>
    </div>

    <div id="div">
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Can Improve Energy Levels and Reaction Times</li>
            <p>Caffeine blocks an inhibitory neurotransmitter in your brain, which causes a stimulant effect. This
                improves energy levels, mood and various aspects of brain function.</p>
            <li>Can Help You Burn Fat</li>
            <p>Several studies show that caffeine can increase fat burning and boost your metabolic rate.</p>
            <li>Can Drastically Improve Physical Performance</li>
            <p>Caffeine can increase adrenaline levels and release fatty acids from your fat tissues. It also leads to
                significant improvements in physical performance.</p>
            <li>Contains Essential Nutrients</li>
            <p>Coffee contains several important nutrients, including riboflavin, pantothenic acid, manganese,
                potassium, magnesium and niacin.</p>
                <li>May Lower Your Risk of Type 2 Diabetes</li>
                <p>Several observational studies show that coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a
                    serious condition that affects millions of people worldwide.</p>


            </p></ol> </div>
<div id="div1">
    <ol type="1" start="6">
                <li>May Protect You From Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia</li>
                <p>Coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of getting Alzheimer’s disease, which is a leading cause of
                    dementia worldwide.</p>
                <li>May Lower Your Risk of Parkinson’s</li>
                <p>Coffee drinkers have up to a 60% lower risk of getting Parkinson’s disease, the second most common
                    neurodegenerative disorder.</p>
                <li>May Protect Your Liver</li>
                <p>Coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of cirrhosis, which can be caused by several diseases that affect
                    the liver.</p>
                <li>Can Fight Depression</li>
                <p>
                    Coffee appears to lower your risk of developing depression and may dramatically reduce suicide risk.
                </p>
                <li> May Lower Risk of Certain Types of Cancer</li>
                <p>Liver and colorectal cancer are the third and fourth leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Coffee
                    drinkers have a lower risk of both.</p>

    <!-- <h2 id="head">Disavantages of Coffee</h2>
    <div id="dis">
       

        <ul>
            <li>Bad coffee can be toxic.</li>
            <p>Bad quality coffee can have a lot of impurities in it, which can cause sickness, headache or a general
                bad feeling. This can happen if your coffee is made from beans that have been over ripped or otherwise
                ruined. Even one ruined bean can make your cup toxic. If you invest and buy high quality, speciality
                coffee you don’t have to worry about this</p>
            <li>Coffee can kill you.</li>
            <p>Yes, if you drink 80-100 cups (23 litres) in a short session. This dose is lethal and will amount in
                10-13 grams of caffeine within your body. Before you reach this point, however, you'll be vomiting most
                of it out since 23 litres of any liquid is a lot. Even drinking 23 litres of water can kill you.</p>
            <li>Coffee can cause insomnia and restlessness.</li>
            <p>Again, it's the caffeine working here. Your recommended maximum amount of caffeine is 400 milligrams,
                roughly the amount that you’ll get from 4 cups of coffee. If you’re caffeine-sensitive, be careful with
                coffee. You are probably already aware what amount and what kind of coffee suits, or doesn't suit you.
                The amount of caffeine that is safe for human consumption is actually written in our DNA.</p>
            <li>Don’t drink more than one cup a day if you’re pregnant.</li>
            <p>Studies on coffee's effect on a fetus have been controversial, but one thing is sure: if you drink coffee
                when pregnant, caffeine will also reach the fetus, and your baby is highly sensitive to caffeine. So, if
                you’re a heavyweight coffee drinker and can’t stop drinking it while pregnant, at least reduce your
                coffee intake to one cup a day.</p>
            <li>If you have high cholesterol please choose filtered coffee.</li>
            <p>Coffee beans contain cafestol and kahweol, two ingredients that appear to raise LDL cholesterol levels.
                Filtering the coffee traps most of the LDL, but cafestol and kahweol are found in espresso, turkish
                coffee, french press and scandinavian style “cooked coffee”.</p>
