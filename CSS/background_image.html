    <div>This is the official flex of movie #HOME</div>
    <p>A still from  Malayalam filmmaker Rojin Thomas is a firm believer of the 'write what you know' school of
        thought. <br> Every character in his films is based on real people that he has actually met, as he told
        indianexpress.com. ... <br> That's how he made his latest film, #Home, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.
    </p><br><br>
    <p id="a">The extremely talented Malayalam actors give their best by experimenting different character in different
        movies <br>
        be it Mammothy, Mohanlal, Jayasurya, Prithviraj etc. Malayalam cinema values, story, plot and cinematography
        rather than stars. <br> The star culture is quite less in Malayalam movies than other film industry.</p>
